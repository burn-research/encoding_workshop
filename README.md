# ENCODING Workshop 15/12/2024

This repo contains a Python notebook with a (very) brief introduction on machine-learning.
The topics are:
- Machine-learning as a Bayesian problem.
- Least-squares regression as a linear problem.
- Least-squares regression as a convex optimisation problem.
- Least-squares regression as a neural network.
- Gaussian Process regression as an explicitely Bayesian problem.
- Latent space and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition.
